## STEPS FOR USING REACT_REDUX_TOOLKIT

# 1.) install the redux/toolkit package by running this command:
    (((( npm install @reduxjs/toolkit  ))))


# 2.) install the react-redux package by running this command:
 <!-- can run only this command for installing redux toolkit and also react-redux at once -->
    (((( npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux ))))


# 3.) Create a Redux Storeâ€‹
Create a file named src/app/store.js. Import the configureStore API from Redux Toolkit. We'll start by creating an empty Redux store, and exporting it:

import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {},
})

# 4.) Provide the Redux Store to react
Once the store is created , we can make it available to our react components by putting a React-Redux <Provider> around our 
application in src/index.js. Import the Redux store we just created, put a <Provider> around your <App> , and pass the store as a prop:
==================
index.js
====================
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import './index.css'
import App from './App'
import { store } from './app/store'
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
